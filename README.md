##Problem Statement
Finding space for short-term storage needs can be expensive and inconvenient. At the same time there are many property owners/renters that have extra space available that would be more than willing to store items for a small fee. The site connects those people. The target audience is college students and other groups who move frequently. 

##Project Technologies/Techniques (in progress...)
- Security / Authentication 
	- Phase one is to use Tomcats built in Auth
	- Phase two is to include 3rd party Authentication via other accounts such as Google or Facebook.
- Google Maps
	- Geocode addresses to display on a map
- Hibernate and MySQL
	- Store users, user information, and user roles
	- Store information about storage locations and spaces available
- Bootstrap
	- Add styling to site
- IntelliJ
	- For a coordinated development
- Log4j
	- To log errors
	- Want to log to different errors to different files
